# The below is used to output information to a screen:
print("Hello World")

# Like algebra, the below  is a way in which I can store information. We have made a location (known as a variable) called "item" and added a value within this:
item = "banana"

# This allows me to print what is stored above
print(item)

# Variables can be updated, code in this program works sequentially, so once the below line is ran, the "item" is changed from "banana" to "apple": 
item = "apple"


# The input() will be used to allow for a user to type something into the program
item = input("Enter in an item you want to display: ")
print(item)
